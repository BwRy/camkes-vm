/* This entire configuration file is a bit of a mess. There is various duplication
 * of information, not to mention the fact that this is all done in macros.
 * Ideally most of the logic for the VMs configuration could be moved to
 * a template and camkes configurations could be used along with some slightly
 * nicer code generation.
 *
 * When modifying this it is important to remember that some macros just expand to
 * their contents, and some macros are expected to be used in boost list expansions
 * and care must be taken to get the syntax correct else difficult to debug build
 * errors will occur. For a boost list an empty list would be defined here as
   #define EMPTY_LIST()
 * Where as a list with one element is
   #define ONE_ELEMENT() \
        element \
   )
 * And multiple elements becomes
   #define MULTI_ELEMENT() \
        element1, \
        element2, \
        element3
   )
 * Importantly note that you cannot have a trailing comma on the last element
 * of a list
 *
 * Many options have _N varients. The N here refers to which VM number the option
 * applies to. This is the mechanism by which different VMs can be given different
 * resources */

/* Passthrough IRQs are used to give a guest a direct hardware interrupt. The format here

 * source_irq - The interrupt index on the I/O APIC for this device. Note that seL4
 *              does not interrupt remapping of any kind and will just use the default
 * level_triggered - 1 if level triggred 0 if edge triggered. Generally PCI devices are
 *                   level triggered and old ISA devices (serial ports etc) are edge
 *                   triggered
 * active_low - 1 if triggered when low, 0 if triggered when high. Generally
 *              PCI interrupts are active low, and ISA interrupts are active high
 * dest_irq - The IRQ number on the PIC we emulate to Linux to deliver this interrupt
 *            to. Frequently the source and dest irqs will need to be different,
 *            in this case the VMM supports a way to indicate in the PCI config space
